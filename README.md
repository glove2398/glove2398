- 👋 Hi, I’m @glove2398
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, teaching or helping people learn new/old things, eating, and sleeping, spending time with friends, family and my boyfriend.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve my coding skills, be with people, and myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects on the backend to build up my experience and abilities, creating curriculum for computer science related topics, anything that pushes for a better world for those after us.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
